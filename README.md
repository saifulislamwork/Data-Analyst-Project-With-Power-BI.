# Business Sales Visualization.

## Project Objective ( Power BI ):
I developed a comprehensive Power BI project of United States Chocolates Annual Sales report 2022, creating multiple dashboards and tables to analyze the data. This visualization must help the owner of chocolate company for better understend their customer and grow more sales in 2023 & 2024.

## Dataset Used:
- <a href="https://github.com/saifulislamwork/Data-Analyst-Project-With-Power-BI./blob/main/Sample%20Data%20Power%20BI.xlsx"> DATASET </a>

## Project Explanation:
This was the first Power BI dashboard I had used. The dataset that was used included sales, product categories, and shipping information. I found four key conclusions after visualizing and analyzing:

Here are 4 essential insights derived from the Tableau dashboard:
1. The largest box shipments were recorded by Australia, indicating active distribution, while the smallest were recorded by New Zealand, possibly indicating poor market or logistical demand.

2. Overall sales were highest in June, which could be a sign of seasonal demand or a successful mid-year campaign.

3. 50% Dark Bites emerged as the most popular item, whereas Mint Choc Choco had a poor ranking due to unfavorable customer preference.

4. A shift in demand was reflected in the declining revenue patterns for the “Other” category and the rising revenue patterns for milk bars.

These results show how visual data analysis may guide decisions about product emphasis and seasonal strategy.

## Conclusion:

The stark difference in product performance — with “50% Dark Bites” leading sales and “Mint Choc Choco” lagging behind — reinforces the value of consumer preference analysis. These insights underscore the importance of monitoring product-level data to understand what resonates with customers. Moreover, the observed decline in revenue from the “Other” category and the rise in milk bar sales reflect shifting market preferences. For businesses, this means regularly reassessing their product mix and adjusting offerings based on up-to-date data trends to stay aligned with evolving consumer tastes.






## Project Objective ( Tableau ):  

In Tableau, I used sales data from Superstore. Through it, I discovered that Tableau’s visual storytelling feature may easily uncover trends.

## Dataset Used:

- <a href="https://github.com/saifulislamwork/Data-Analyst-Project-With-Power-BI./blob/main/Sample%20-%20Superstore.xls"> DATASET </a>

## Project Explanation:

Here are 6 essential insights derived from the Tableau dashboard:

1. Top-Performing State:
California leads in profitability with a profit of $76,381, followed by New York ($74,039) and Washington ($33,403), indicating strong regional performance.

2. Loss-Making States:
Texas (-$25,729) and Ohio (-$17,725) report the highest losses, signaling a need for deeper analysis into operational inefficiencies or customer behavior in these regions.

3. Most Profitable Sub-Category:
Within furniture, tables generated high sales, but profitability across subcategories varies, emphasizing the importance of analyzing both revenue and profit.

4. Strong Monthly Growth in Technology:
The technology category shows a clear upward trend in sales from March to December, indicating growing demand, especially in Q4.

5. Consistent Performance of Office Supplies:
Office supplies maintain steady sales throughout the year, showcasing this category as a stable revenue stream across months.

6. Sales Range & Profit Spectrum:
Sales across categories range from 920 to 457,688 units, while profits range from –17,725 to 55,618, highlighting the variability in margin performance by category and sub-category.

Through this study, I discovered that businesses may use historical data to guide their future plans.

## Conclusion:

This Tableau analysis of Superstore sales data effectively highlights key performance trends and areas for attention. The dashboard reveals California and New York as profit powerhouses, while Texas and Ohio present significant loss areas requiring investigation. Drilling down into product categories shows Tables driving furniture sales, though profitability varies within the segment. Notably, Technology demonstrates strong growth towards the year's end, contrasting with the stable, consistent performance of Office Supplies. The wide range in both sales volume and profit margins underscores the need for nuanced strategies tailored to specific regions and product sub-categories. Ultimately, this project demonstrates Tableau's power in transforming raw data into actionable insights, enabling businesses to leverage historical performance for informed future planning and strategic decision-making.
