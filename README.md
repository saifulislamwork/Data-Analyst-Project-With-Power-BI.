# United States Chocolates Sales Visualization.

## Project Objective:
I developed a comprehensive Power BI project of United States Chocolates Annual Sales report 2022, creating multiple dashboards and tables to analyze the data. This visualization must help the owner of chocolate company for better understend their customer and grow more sales in 2023 & 2024.

## Project Explanation:
This was the first Power BI dashboard I had used. The dataset that was used included sales, product categories, and shipping information. I found four key conclusions after visualizing and analyzing:

Here are 4 essential insights derived from the Tableau dashboard:
1. The largest box shipments were recorded by Australia, indicating active distribution, while the smallest were recorded by New Zealand, possibly indicating poor market or logistical demand.

2. Overall sales were highest in June, which could be a sign of seasonal demand or a successful mid-year campaign.

3. 50% Dark Bites emerged as the most popular item, whereas Mint Choc Choco had a poor ranking due to unfavorable customer preference.

4. A shift in demand was reflected in the declining revenue patterns for the “Other” category and the rising revenue patterns for milk bars.

These results show how visual data analysis may guide decisions about product emphasis and seasonal strategy.
